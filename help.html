             <p>NTEHub Writer is a suite of interactive tools; providing note taking capabilities based around audio and video recordings. The application allows users* to create recordings and bookmarks and add text notes and attachments such as images and documents to their bookmarks. There are a range of organizational features to complement the user experience. ‘Labels’ allow the user to colour-categorize their bookmarks. ‘Keywords’ enable the user to mark out specific text for further categorization. The user can also export their project content (bookmarks and notes) in a customizable printed format.</p> 
 
                Full user access to Writer is part of the NTE ‘Notes and Writer’ and ‘UK Student’ subscription. 
                 
                *The user must have an NTE ‘Notes and Writer’ or ‘UK Student’ subscription to access all the features of NTEHub Writer. </br><br/>
              
              <a id="boat"><u><h3>1.2 Introduction to the interface</h3></u></a>
              <p>NTEHub Writer is designed with the affordance of familiarity as a key fundamental in the layout of the user interface. The main areas of the interface consist of the <strong>media toolbar​,​ media track timebar​, ​sidebar​, ​workspace​</strong> and <strong>edit column</strong>​. 
             
              <p>The flow of user interaction for task performance has a clear hierarchical order from ‘left to right’: The higher-navigation functions can be found in the <strong>sidebar</strong>​, displaying the content in the central <strong>workspace</strong>​; this content can be viewed and edited in more detail in the <strong>edit column</strong>​. Situated above these components is the <strong>media track​ timebar</strong>​ which displays playback progress of the media recording as well as visual placement of <strong>bookmark graphics</strong>​. ​Situated above the aforementioned component is the <strong>media toolbar</strong>​​ containing the main controls for media recording and playback. It also contains high-level commands for project management and workflow such as the <strong>‘Add Bookmark’ button</strong>​​. At the top of the user interface is the user account bar which enables the user access to their <strong>user profile</strong>.</br>
              
              <a id="sea"><u><h3>1.3 sidebar, workspace and edit column</h3></u></a>
              <p>The <strong>sidebar</strong>​​ is the main access point for project management navigation (see image 1.3.1). Each tab consists of a heading and icon. The default tabs displaying in the sidebar are the <strong>​board tab​, ​bookmarks tab​, ​labels tab​, ​keywords tab​</strong> and <strong>files tab​</strong>. Pressing one of the tabs accesses the <strong>workspace</strong> for that respective tab. Some of the tabs contain additional functionality; the <strong>bookmarks tab</strong>​ includes a ​<strong>chevron icon</strong>  to the right which controls the appearance of the <strong>bookmarks list</strong> ​(see chapter 4.4)​. ​The <strong>keywords tab​</strong> also contains a number tally to the right which displays how many keywords are in the project. 
              
              <p>The sidebar can also be resized by pressing the <strong>chevron icon</strong>​ in the top left area above the <strong>board tab</strong> ​. (See image 1.3.2.) The reduced version of the sidebar (shorter width) displays only the tab icons and increases the <strong>workspace</strong>​ area. 
              
              <p>The <strong>workspace​</strong> area is where the majority of user-generated content is displayed and accessed (see image 1.3.3). At the top of the ​<strong>workspace</strong> area is the <strong>workspace toolbar</strong>. This contains common components like ​<strong>sort</strong>​ functionality. Adjusting the <strong>sort</strong>​ value will affect the order (from top to bottom) of workspace content on screen. Aligned at the right of the workspace toolbar is the <strong>search</strong>​ tool and the <strong>toggle video display button</strong>​. 
              
              <p>Any selected content panel from the ​<strong>workspace</strong> will display in the <strong>edit column</strong>. The content displayed in the <strong>edit column</strong>​ provides a more detailed view of the content and in most cases there is more functionality available to edit or view the selected content (see chapter <strong>3.3</strong>​​ or chapter <strong>4.0</strong>​​ as an example). </br><br/>

              <p>A <strong>'project'</strong> is the encompassing workfile containing all user-generated content, including the media recording. When an audio or video recording is created or uploaded from the NTEHub dashboard it is converted to a project and listed in the <strong>My Projects</strong> screen. When a project is opened it launches in Writer. </br> 
              
              <p>A new project can be created from the <strong>My Dashboard</strong>​ area by pressing the <strong>‘New Project’ button</strong>. ​Once the creation steps have been completed the project will automatically open in a new browser tab.</br>
              
              <p>Any changes or updates made to the project are automatically saved;<u>there is no need to manually save progress inside a project</u>. To close a project simply close the browser tab that the project editor is running in. All projects are listed and displayed in the <strong>​My Projects</strong>​ page. The name of a project can be edited inside Writer by clicking on the <strong>​project title​</strong> shown on the right side of the ​<strong>media toolbar</strong>.</br>

              <p>Creating a recording is a simple task, but it does require that no media recording is already present in the project. Simply press the <strong>record button</strong> ​(the round button with an ‘r’, see image 2.1.1) this will open a menu panel dropdown; selecting ​<strong>‘Record Audio’</strong>​ will start the recording process. A recording input device (i.e. microphone) must be operable in order to perform this action. The interface will change in appearance (see image 2.1.2) to signal that recording in now taking place and the <strong>record button</strong>​ changes in appearance. To stop recording press the ​<strong>record button</strong>  once again. The interface reverts to the standard appearance and the media recording is now present in the project. Depending on internet and server speed there may be a short delay before the media recording ‘loads’ inside the project (see image 2.1.3). When a media recording is present in a project this is signaled by the ‘black’ appearance of the ​media track timebar. ​When there is no media recording in a project the ​media track timebar​ appears ‘grey’.</br>

              <p>Video recording involves the same interactive process as audio recording but with the addition of the ​video player​. Pressing the ​record button ​will open a menu panel dropdown; selecting ​‘Record Video’​ will start the recording process. A visual recording input device (i.e. camera) must be operable in order to perform this action. The interface will change in appearance (see image 2.1.2) to signal that recording in now taking place and the ​record button​ changes appearance. The video player panel opens in the edit column. Various controls for the video player are explained in the topic chapter ​‘2.6 Video Player ​ ’. To stop recording press the ​record button​ once again. The interface reverts to the standard appearance and the media recording is now present in the project. Depending on internet and server speed there may be a short delay before the media recording ‘loads’ inside the project (see image 2.1.3). When a media recording is present in a project this is signaled by the ‘black’ appearance of the <strong>​media track timebar</strong>. ​When there is no media recording in a project the <strong>media track timebar</strong>​ appears ‘grey’.</br>
              
             <a id="bmw"><u><h3>2.3 Uploading a recording into a project</h3></u></a> 
              <p>If the project has no media recording already loaded then an alternative to the recording process is to upload a media file into the project. This can be done by pressing the <strong>​‘Add Track’ button</strong>​ found in the ​<strong>media toolbar</strong> ​(see image 2.3.1)​. Pressing the button will open the user device file browser window. The following media files formats are acceptable:</br>
              <ul>.mp3</ul> 
              <ul>.mp4</ul> 
              <ul>.m4a</ul>

             <a id="ford"><u><h3>2.4 Playback</h3></u></a>
              <p>If a project recording is loaded the recording can be played. Make sure an audio output device is connected (e.g speakers or headphones).  Playback can be controlled from the <strong>​media toolbar</strong>​. Pressing the play icon will play the project recording; when playback is active the play icon switches to the pause icon. The timing of the playback can be controlled by mouse selecting a point in the <strong>media track timebar​</strong>. If there are bookmarks present then the <strong>​bookmark graphic</strong> can be selected to play the project recording from that point in time. The skip forward and skip back icons can be used to play the recording from the next/previous bookmark.</br>

              <a id="drive"><u><h3>2.5 Volume and playback speed</h3></u></a>
              <p>The volume control is located in the ​media toolbar​ (see image 2.5.1). The ​volume slider​ can be controlled using the ​volume slider handle​; once selected this can be moved to adjust the volume value. Below the ​volume slider​ are a group of buttons that control the speed of the playback*. The default selection is ‘1.0’ (normal speed). The other two buttons, if selected, will play the project recording at half-speed (0.5) and double-speed (1.5). 
 
                *In some user accounts the speed control needs to be enabled from the ‘Settings’ screen in the User Dashboard.</br>

              <p> The <strong>​video player​</strong> appearance (showing or hiding the panel) is controlled by the <strong>toggle video display button</strong> ​(see image 2.6.1). As a default setting, whenever there is video content, as part of a project recording, the <strong>video player</strong>​ panel will always open. If the <strong>video player</strong>​ panel has been hidden it will always reappear when playback is started. 
              <p> There are a number of controls that display in the ​<strong>video player​ panel</strong>. The icons and their functionality are shown in image 2.6.2.  
              <p> Reducing the size of the ​<strong>video player</strong> panel when inside the <strong>edit column</strong>​, ​by pressing the​ <strong>thumbnail view icon</strong>, allows any content shown underneath (e.g a note panel) to take up more room in the <strong>edit column</strong>​, making it easier to access this content. The video player can also be undocked from the edit column, by pressing the ​<strong>undock video icon</strong>​ to appear in a separate window. 
              <p> The video player view can also be changed to a ‘full screen’ effect (cinema view) by clicking on the ​<strong>cinema view icon</strong>. ​Be aware that when the <strong>video player timebar</strong>​ is in this view the ​<strong>sidebar</strong>​ and <strong>workspace​</strong> content cannot be accessed. However the <strong>media toolbar​</strong> and the ​media track timebar​ remain accessible. 
              <p> The video player also utilizes its own <strong>​control bar​</strong> with accompanying functions (see image 2.6.3). The <strong>video player timebar</strong>​ matches the proportionate playback of the <strong>media track timebar</strong>. ​So the project recording can also be controlled from the <strong>video player​</strong> with play and pause functionality included as well as the ability to mouse select the timebar to go to that time in the project recording. Volume control is also accessible from the <strong>control bar​</strong></br>

                    <p>Notes is a key feature for user-generated content in Writer. A ‘note’ is made up of text. Notes can exist in both the <strong>​board workspace</strong>​, as independent items, or in the <strong>bookmarks</strong>​ (within a bookmark). Notes display in singular panels in the workspace area, and when selected, appear in the edit column in a larger panel. The note can be edited from this panel.

                    <p>Notes can be created from within the <strong>board workspace</strong>​​ and the <strong>bookmarks workspace</strong>​​. To create a note from the <strong>board workspace</strong>​ press the ​add icon​ found in the ​notes toolbar​ and select the <strong>​‘Add Text Note’</strong>​ option from the menu panel (see image 3.2.1). This will generate a new ‘note’ that will appear as a <strong>note panel</strong>​​ in the ​<strong>workspace​</strong> area.</br>
                    <p>To create a note from the <strong>​bookmarks workspace</strong>​ first identify the bookmark in which the note should appear. In the row that displays the bookmark heading there are a group of three icons aligned to the right. Press the <strong>add icon​</strong> and select <strong>'​Add Text Note’​</strong>strong from the menu panel (see screenshot 3.2.2). This will generate a new note within the bookmark. </br>

                    <p>Capabilities for editing a note are similar in features to many standard text-editing tools. When a note is selected in the ​<strong>workspace</strong>​ the ​<strong>note panel</strong> will also display in the ​<strong>edit column</strong>. The <strong>​edit column</strong>​ will display the content of the note in its entirety whereas the <strong>note panel</strong>​​ in the <strong>workspace</strong>​​ will only display the content of the note up to the boundaries of the note panel size. If the ​note panel​ in the ​edit column​ is selected the cursor will appear which enables text creation. The note heading can also be edited. When text is entered it will automatically update in the respective note panel​ in the ​workspace​. The ​<strong>note panel</strong>​ in the<strong>edit column</strong>​ includes the <strong>text edit toolbar</strong> ​which sits at the bottom of the panel. The full list of editing commands is shown in image 3.3.1.</br> 
                    <p>Along with the visual interface of the ​<strong>text edit toolbar​</strong>, standard shortcut keys exist to replicate many of the ​<strong>text edit toolbar</strong> functions. There is also a <strong>spell checker</strong>tool available (see chapter 3.8). </br>

                    <p>An aspect of good note organization is making sure notes, when necessary, exist within appropriate bookmarks. If a series of notes are created in the ​<strong>board workspace</strong> they will not be assigned to a bookmark. The ‘send to bookmark’ feature 
                      Help Centre Content - Project Editor  -  v0.0.3 - NTEHub / Writer 
                      makes this possible. Likewise, if a note exists in a bookmark but needs to move to a different bookmark the ‘send to bookmark’ feature can make this happen.</br>  
                       
                  <p>To ‘send’ a note to a bookmark, first find the note that requires moving (sending). When the ​<strong>note panel</strong>​ is selected (or hovered over with the mouse pointer) the <strong>options icon</strong>​ will appear in the top right of the ​<strong>note panel</strong>. Pressing the <strong>options icon</strong>​​ will activate a menu panel. Selecting the command ​‘Send To..’​ will activate a sub-panel displaying all bookmarks inside the project. Simply select the bookmark that the note should move to. It is worth noting that when a note is ‘sent’ it will no longer exist in its original location i.e. sending a note does not make a copy of the note</br>
        
                   <a id="#ruby"><u><h3>3.5 Moving a note</h3></u></a>
                      <p>Sending a note (chapter 3.4) is one method of moving a note. A note can also be moved by selecting the note panel with the mouse, holding the selection and dragging the panel into a new position. This operation can be performed in both the <strong>board workspace​</strong> and <strong>the ​bookmark workspace</strong>​. A note panel can also be dragged from the <strong>board workspace</strong> into the bookmarks sidebar (into a bookmark).</br>

                    <p>Identify the note in the appropriate workspace <strong>(​board or bookmarks workspace​)</strong>. Access the <strong>options icon</strong>​ by pressing or hovering over the <strong>note panel</strong>​. Pressing the <strong>options icon</strong>​ will open the menu panel; select the <strong>​‘Delete’​</strong> command from the list. A new copy of the note will now appear next to the original note.</br>

Access the <strong>​options icon</strong>​ by pressing or hovering over the ​note panel​. Pressing the options icon​ will open the menu panel; select the ​<strong>‘Delete’</strong>​ command from the list. The note is now permanently deleted from the project. </br>

                    <p>NTEhub Writer comes with spell checking capabilities. The feature can be accessed directly from the <strong>​text edit toolbar</strong>​ (see image 3.3.1) or from the options menu in the note panel or bookmarks title area.</br>
 
                    <p>The spell checker interface is similar to Microsoft Word and other common word processing programs. The spell check targeting can be customized by ‘adding’ words to the dictionary. This prevents the added words from flagging up as a spelling error in future spell checks.</br>

                      <p>‘Bookmarks’ are the predominant feature through which user-generated content is worked with alongside the project recording. Bookmarking creates a reference point, in the form of a timestamp that can be used to recall to that position in the project recording. There are three areas of the interface that relate to different management levels of the bookmarks feature; the ​<strong>sidebar</strong>​, the <strong>media track timebar</strong> ​and the <strong>bookmarks workspace​</strong>. These areas are covered in detail in further chapters (see 4.3, 4.4, 4.5) </br>
                    <a id="#brian"> <u><h3>4.2 Creating a bookmark</h3></u></a>
                      <p>Creating a bookmark is a simple process. As a requirement there must be a project recording present or a recording must be in progress. The ​<strong>‘add bookmark’ button</strong>​ is situated in the​ <strong>media toolbar</strong>​ (see image 4.2.1), it has a bold turquoise colour (the button colour will appear desaturated (disabled) if there is no project recording). Pressing the <strong>​‘add bookmark’ button​</strong> will add a new bookmark to the project. In order to see the bookmark appear in the ​<strong>bookmarks workspace</strong>​ the <strong>​bookmarks tab​</strong> must be selected in the ​<strong>sidebar</strong>. </br>
                      <p>Bookmarks can be added during a recording or when a project recording is already present. They can also be added during playback; during play or when the recording is paused. </br>
                        
                    <a id="#ivy"><u><h3>4.3 Bookmarks and the media track timebar</h3></u></a>
                      <p>When a bookmark is created a <strong>​bookmark graphic​</strong> appears on the ​<strong>media track timebar</strong>​. The ​<strong>bookmark graphic</strong>​ is numbered according to the total bookmarks that already exist (i.e. if it is the first bookmark then it will be numbered ‘1’ and so forth).    </br> 
                      <p>The position the bookmark appears on the ​<strong>media track timebar</strong>​ depends on the state of the project recording. If the project recording is already present and not in playback mode then the <strong>bookmark graphic</strong>​ will appear at the start of the recording (at the beginning of the <strong>media track timebar</strong>​).​ ​If the project recording is in playback mode the ​<strong>bookmark graphic​</strong> will appear at the current moment of playback (i.e. at the end of the ​<strong>progress bar​</strong>). If playback is paused it will also appear in this place. If the recording is taking place (i.e. recording in real time) the ​<strong>bookmark graphic​</strong> will appear at the end of the <strong>​media track timebar​</strong>.</br>
                      <p>Interacting with ​<strong>bookmark graphics</strong> on the <strong>​media track timebar</strong>​ enables various effects and actions. Pressing the <strong>bookmark graphic</strong>​ will play the project recording from that point in time. Selecting the <strong>bookmark graphic</strong>​ (by either pressing it and holding or click-dragging the mouse pointer over it) allows further functionality:<strong>bookmark graphics</strong>​ can be moved along the <strong>​media track timebar​</strong>; changing the timestamp. When a <strong>bookmark graphic</strong>​ is in transit the timestamp appears temporarily below the graphic* (see screenshot 4.3.1). Selected bookmarks can also be set for exporting; if the <strong>export button</strong>​ is pressed the ​<strong>export to document preview​</strong> will only target the selected bookmarks. There is more on the topic of exporting in the ‘Export To Document’ chapter (10.0).</br> 
                      <p><i>*Mouse pointer hovering over a bookmark graphic also reveals the timestamp*</i></br>
                      
                    <a id="#public"><u><h3>4.4 bookmark and the sidebar</h3></u></a>
                      <p>When a bookmark is created it is listed within the <strong>bookmarks tab​</strong> in the <strong>​sidebar</strong>​. This enables improved/efficient access to a summarized form of the bookmark data. To access the <strong>​bookmarks</strong> list​ press the ​chevron icon​ to the right (see screenshot 4.4.1) this opens the ​bookmarks list​. Press it again to close the list.</br> 
                      <p>The <strong>​bookmarks list</strong>​ shows the ​<strong>bookmark heading​</strong> and <strong>​timestamp​</strong>. It also displays a coloured graphic if a label is assigned to the bookmark (more on labels in chapter 6.0). Pressing a bookmark inside the ​bookmarks list​ will scroll/navigate the content of the <strong>bookmarks workspace</strong> ​to that specific bookmark.</br>
          
                    <a id="#state"><u><h3>4.5 Managing bookmarks in the workspace</h3></u></a>
                      <p>The <strong>​bookmarks workspace​</strong> area displays all user-generated content that has been created in, or attached to, a bookmark. All content for a bookmark appears below the <strong>bookmark heading​</strong> which is clearly set within a white container. To the right of the bookmark heading is the <strong>play icon​, ​add icon</strong>​ and <strong>options icon</strong> ​(see screenshot 4.5.1). Pressing the <strong>​play icon​</strong> will affect the <strong>​media track timebar</strong> ​and play the project recording from that (bookmark) moment. Pressing the ​<strong>add icon​</strong> will open a menu panel to add content to the bookmark (see chapter 4.6).</br>
                      <p>The​ <strong>bookmarks workspace</strong>​ content can be sorted using the <strong>​sort​</strong> function found in the <strong>​bookmarks toolbar</strong> ​(see image 4.5.1). When there is no recording in a project the <strong>​bookmarks workspace​</strong> is, by default, sorted by ‘Number Descending’ which will, when a recording is in progress, allow the user to see each newly added bookmark appear at the top of the <strong>​bookmarks workspace</strong>.​ When a recording has been created the default sort option switches to ‘Timeline Ascending’ to allow the user to view the bookmarks in numbered order as they appear on the <strong>​media track timebar.</strong></br>

                      <p>Content can be added to a bookmark by pressing the ​<strong>add icon</strong> found on the right of the <strong>bookmark heading​</strong> container in the <strong>bookmarks workspace</strong>​. In the menu panel that appears there are two options;<strong>‘​Add Text Note’</strong>​ and <strong>‘​Add Attachment’</strong>​. The <strong>‘​Add Text Note’</strong>​ command will instantly create a new note <strong>(​note panel​)</strong> inside the bookmark. The <strong>‘​Add Attachment’</strong>​ command will open a sub menu with two options:<strong>‘From Device’​</strong> which Pressing the central area of the window will activate the device file browser from which a (compatible) file can be selected and added to the bookmark as an attachment (see chapter 5.0). The <strong>‘​From Project’</strong> ​command will open a window enabling the user to select from attached content already present inside the project. </br>

To assign a label press the ​<strong>options icon</strong>​ found on the right of the <strong>​bookmark heading</strong>​ container in the <strong>​bookmarks workspace</strong>.​ In the list of menu options select the <strong>‘​Assign Label’</strong> command. This will open a sub panel with the list of labels. At least one label must be created in order for a label to be assigned to a bookmark. Once a label has been assigned to a bookmark the <strong>‘​Remove Label’​</strong> command (in the options menu) can be used to remove the label from the bookmark.</br>
  
                    <a id="#small"><u><h3>4.8 bookmarks</h3></u></a>
                      <p>‘Exporting’ refers to the ‘Export to Document’ feature covered in more detail in chapter 10.0. The feature converts bookmark content into a printable format. When the <strong>​actions button</strong>​ (located in the <strong>​media toolbar</strong>, ​see image 4.8.1) is pressed the menu panel appears. Selecting <strong>‘​Export To Document’</strong>​ command will open the <strong>export to document preview​</strong> (see image 4.8.2). If bookmarks have been selected the export will only target those bookmarks in the ​<strong>export to document preview​</strong>. But if no bookmarks have been selected the export will target all the bookmarks in the project*.

                      <p>To remove a bookmark from the <strong>​media track timebar</strong>​ there are two options. The first option is to delete the bookmark; this permanently discards the bookmark and all of its content (see chapter 4.10). The second option is to convert the bookmark to a <strong>‘floating bookmark’</strong>​. The floating bookmarks feature is covered in more detail in chapter 9.0. This feature allows the user to remove the bookmark from the <strong>media track timebar​</strong> but maintain access to the bookmark content within the project from a tab in the <strong>​sidebar</strong>​.</br>
                      <p>To remove a bookmark as a floating bookmark press the <strong>options icon​</strong> located to the right in the <strong>​bookmark heading​</strong> container. From the menu options select the <strong>‘Remove From Timeline’</strong>​ command.</br>
